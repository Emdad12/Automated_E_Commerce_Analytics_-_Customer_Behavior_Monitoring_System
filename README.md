# Automated E-Commerce Analytics – Customer Behavior Monitoring System

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end e-commerce data analytics workflow using Python.
Multiple raw datasets were cleaned, integrated, and analyzed to understand customer behavior,
revenue patterns, and promotional effectiveness.

The project focuses on **data quality, statistical analysis, and experimentation**, following
industry-style analytics practices.

---

## Datasets Used
- Customer dataset (demographics, device, location)
- Product dataset (category, seasonality, attributes)
- Transaction dataset (orders, pricing, revenue)
- Session & clickstream dataset (user engagement)

Final analytical dataset contains **850,000+ records**.

---

## Project Workflow
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing of raw datasets
2. Dataset integration and feature engineering
3. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
4. Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing
5. A/B testing for promotional effectiveness

## Notebook-wise Analysis Summary

### 01_data_cleaning.ipynb — Data Cleaning & Integration
- Cleaned four raw datasets (customer, product, transaction, session)
- Handled missing values, incorrect data types, and duplicate records
- Standardized columns and merged datasets into a unified analytical table
- Produced a final clean dataset with over 850,000 records for analysis

# Next Phase: Machine Learning & Deep Learning (Planned)

This project will be extended with predictive and advanced modeling techniques to move from
descriptive and inferential analytics toward decision automation.
