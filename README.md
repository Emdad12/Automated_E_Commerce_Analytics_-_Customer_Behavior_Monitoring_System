# Automated E-Commerce Analytics – Customer Behavior Monitoring System

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end e-commerce data analytics workflow using Python.
Multiple raw datasets were cleaned, integrated, and analyzed to understand customer behavior,
revenue patterns, and promotional effectiveness.

The project focuses on **data quality, statistical analysis, and experimentation**, following
industry-style analytics practices.

## Datasets Used
- Customer dataset (demographics, device, location)
- Product dataset (category, seasonality, attributes)
- Transaction dataset (orders, pricing, revenue)
- Session & clickstream dataset (user engagement)

Final analytical dataset contains **850,000+ records**.
